# OAI API Checker
## Program that allows you to check all the available information about your OAI API keys

**Download**: OAI_API_Checker.exe - https://drive.proton.me/urls/4T2QGJFBGM#fW0YsN9WskCG

Basically, you put in one or an array of keys and the program analyzes them for you.

It prints out what models are available for the key and if it is out of quota or not. It will also store the gpt-4 and turbo keys in their respective .txt files in the folder where you run the program.

Program is pretty fast and reliable. Just in case, the program will generate a .log file where all debug info will be stored. Feel free to send them to me in case of bugs and errors (buhankoanon@proton.me).

In this repository, you can find a a link to compiled .exe file of the program (all necessary libraries included), as well as a source Python code.

In order to run the source Python code, you will need Python, pip and modules such as openai, requests, colorama.
